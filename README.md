# Arch For Humans

ArchForHumans is an script that tries to make the Arch installation more easy, but without taking the essential of it. It is composed by two scripts. I plan making a third (for desktop and graphical programs), but for now, these two will be good for a base install (no desktop) of Arch Linux.
